# GA Project 4: IGLOO

#### MERN-Stack Application

## About Igloo

With the rising cost in living, a quick grocery trip is costing an arm and leg. Forgetting whatâ€™s in your fridge is even more frustrating. Before you know it, most of the food has gone off and a lot of money has gone to waste. Igloo is a MERN-Stack application that aims to help organise your fridge, save you money and help reduce food waste. With Igloo, you can catalogue the items in your fridge and track their use-by dates to make sure you before they go bad. Once you finish your grocery items, you can move them to your shopping list for future reference when you go shopping.

Say goodbye to wasted food and hello to a more organised and efficient fridge. Say hello to Igloo.

## Reflections

It feels surreal to be at the end of SEI, having started this journey 3 months ago. But I can assure you that this week did not fly by. This Final project I kept my application idea relatively simple as I was quite intimidated by React and the MERN Stack as a whole. Fittingly project 4 was equal parts fun and frustrating. While working with React, I had moments where everything clicked and I could make progress with ease. However, I also encountered a significant obstacle on Wednesday when attempting to dynamically render form fields in my add item component (Fridge). I spent a significant amount of Wednesday looking through components trying to figure it out, which stunted the overall progress of the project. As a result a few icebox features were left on the shelf.

Despite the challenge, I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I hope you enjoy it too.

## Project Next Steps

1. Nutrition API: One of my icebox features was to include nurtition data to the user on the food they catalogue. Unfortunately i ran out of time and was unable to achieve this.

2. Info Page: Another icebox feature was to include a page with artciles about food preservation and storing , as well as information about how best to utilise food.
